# Friend-Finder

#### This is a comptability-based "FriendFinder" application, like a dating app. 

#### This is a full-stack site that intakes the users' surveys then compares answers with other users. 

#### The app then displays the name and picture of their best overall match.

## What I Learned

#### In order to build this app, I used Express to handle the routing.

#### Also, this assignment was an introduction to deploying to Heroku.
